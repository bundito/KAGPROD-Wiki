====== Copying or Moving Files ======

Copying and moving files in [[file_station|File Station]] is just as easy as copying or moving files in Windows Explorer or OSX Finder.

=== Copy versus Move ====

Copying and moving files follow the exact same steps. The only difference is that **copy** will leave the original files behind and put a copy in the destination; **move** will erase the original files and only preserve the copy in the destination direction.

=== How To ===


To begin, select the files you want to work with:

{{:files-chosen.png?400|}}

Right-clicking on the files (or pressing the **Action** button) will bring up a contextual menu. Move down until you see **Copy to.../Move to...**.

You're then asked to choose a destination folder. In this example, we'll be moving our three items into the **home/Public** directory. Your files and folders will be very different.

Use the triangle buttons to expand and collapse the directories as needed. Then select the destination.

{{:copy-move-dest.png?400|}}

You'll see a progress bar in the center of the screen.

And then, the process is complete. If you've chosen **move**, the screen will refresh and the moved files will be absent.

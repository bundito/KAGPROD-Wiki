====== Downloading Files ======

Downloading files is very simple. It's just a matter of choosing them from File Station and selection the **Download** Action.

File station will look like this:

{{ :file-station.png?400 |}}

Choose the file(s) you want to download. You can use standard Windows Explorer or OSX Finder to choose multiple files:

{{ :files-chosen.png?400 |}}

In the menu bar of File Station, find the **Action** dropdown option. Choose **Download**.

{{ :download-chosen.png?400 |}}

You will be prompted for a save destination, just like any other web download. That's all there is to it.

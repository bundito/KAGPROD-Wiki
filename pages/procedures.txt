You should have been given a username and password. Enter them now.

Close the two help windows, for now. They'll reappear the next time you log in.

Once logged in, you should see a desktop similar to this:

{{ :dsm-desktop.png?400 |}}

This desktop is officially known as **Disk Station Manager**, or **DSM**. You'll probably find that name in the included help function.

You will be doing most of your work in [[File Station]]. This is where you will [[upload]] and [[download]] files. Everyone works in the same public space, so please be careful with files belonging to others.

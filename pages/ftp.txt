===== FTP Access =====

If you prefer to use FTP rather than the [[web-interface|web interface]] or [[local-drive|local drive]] methods, here are the details. For this example, we're using the free [[https://filezilla-project.org/|Filezilla]] FTP client. Your client may look different, but the processes are the same.

<code>

Server name: kagprod.synology.me
User name: (The username you were given to access the server)
Password: (Your password)
Port: (Leave blank for the default)

</code>

Here is the FTP client ready to connect:

Once connected, the file server's files and folders will be listed in the **remote site** view of your FTP client:

{{ :remote-site.png?400 |}}

You may now use the standard **Upload** and **Download** functions of your FTP client.

When you are done, close your client or choose the **Disconnect** function.

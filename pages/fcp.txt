===== Sharing FCPX Libraries =====

Annoyingly, FCPX does not like shared network folders. So we have to cheat the system. We do this by using disk "images", which are files you can mount like a regular disk. We'll keep our libraries on these fake disks and swap them back and forth.

In each project, you'll find a file named something like 

<code>
<projectname>.sparseimage
</code>

(The images shown below are using test disks, so disregard the names and the file locations.)

{{:fcp-diskimage.png?400|}}

Drag this file out of the Finder and onto your desktop.

{{:fcp-drag-out.png?400|}}

It may take a few minutes to transfer.

Once it's done, check your desktop for a file that looks like this:

{{:fcp-sparse-icon.png?400|}}

Double-click that file to "mount" the fake disk as if it were a real, regular disk. Once mounted, you'll see an icon on your desktop like this:

{{:fcp-mounted-disk.png?400|}}

Now you've got that sparseimage file mounted as if it were a disk. From here, you'll use this disk with Final Cut Pro. I'm no expert on FCP, but I can show the very basic usage.

If a library for a video project hasn't already been started, go to **File > New Library** and make sure your fake disk is selected under **Devices**.

{{:fcp-new-project.png?400|}}

Your file will be created and you can work normally.

==== If A Project Already Exists ====

Open it by starting it FCP, and choosing the fake sparseimage disk from **Devices**, just like shown above. double-click your project file and start work like normal.

===== When You Are Finished Editing =====

Unmount the fake disk by dragging the disk drive icon to the trash.

{{:dismount.png?200 |}}

The drive will be disconnected from your system and return to being just an ordinary file.

Drag the matching .sparseimage file back into your Finder connection to the server. 

Wait for it to process. Again, it may take a few moments.

That's it. You've edited and/or created a shareable disk image file. It's ready for the next user in the workflow to use. They should just follow these directions and all will be good.
